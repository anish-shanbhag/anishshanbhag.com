        Learn about programming in a whole new way with AutoBlog. <br /> <br />
        Todayâ€™s blogging sites just arenâ€™t made for sharing code. Tired of
        reading about the way your folder structure should look or trying to
        decide whether your terminal output matches the authorâ€™s? We have tools
        for those things - theyâ€™re called code editors. Why not learn to code in
        the same place you write it? <br /> <br />
        With AutoBlog, you can connect you own codebase in one click and scroll
        through tutorial articles like{" "}
        <a href="https://scrollycoding-preview-anish-shanbhag.vercel.app/posts/dotted-curve">
          this one about creating a cool-looking design
        </a>
        , all while watching your local code change in real-time as the author
        explains each step. Blog authors can even highlight snippets of code
        that tie into their explanations and insights, making it easier than
        ever to understand how the authorâ€™s written ideas connect with your own
        project. <br /> <br />

        BlendCanvas is a new JavaScript-esque programming language which is used
        to write compute and fragment shaders that are optimized to run on the
        GPU. This enables web and game developers to easily create complex
        graphics even if they&apos;re unfamiliar with GLSL, which is the
        low-level, often hard-to-understand language that you&apos;d normally
        use to write these shaders. BlendCanvas is nearly identical to
        JavaScript with a few extra features to make writing GPU code easier,
        and seamlessly compiles to GLSL for full interoperability with the
        larger shader ecosystem. <br />
        <br />
        Along with writing a full parser and compiler for the language itself,
        I&apos;ve also created a showcase platform where people can share their
        shaders and edit them in the browser without the need to download any
        additional software. All shaders are stored persistently using Firebase
        storage and authentication, so your creations will be available forever!

        Graph partitioning is often an NP-hard problem, meaning that it's
        computationally extremely hard to find the optimal solution. In this
        project, my team researched and developed a highly efficient algorithm
        for one problem in this domain: determining the optimal way to divide
        people into teams so that the teams are even, while also placing
        individuals who like each other on the same team. <br />
        <br />
        This problem might seem intuitively straightforward but it quickly
        became clear that even for a small number of individuals, the possible
        search space was enormous: over 10^30 combinations! We initially
        experimented in Python with basic optimization approaches like KMeans
        and various greedy approaches, but these weren't quite sufficient.
        <br /> <br />
        After quite a bit of investigation, we landed on an approach that
        combines two highly effective algorithms. The first is a formulation of
        the graph partitioning problem as an{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">
          integer linear program
        </a>
        , which we implemented using the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a> optimization engine. We
        found that this approach was guaranteed to give us the optimal team
        partition due to the precision of our formulation, but the limitation
        was that solving for the optimum often took multiple hours, or even
        longer depending on the difficulty of the specific input. <br />
        <br />
        To get around this, we used another type of algorithm which is much
        faster at the cost of a bit of accuracy: simulated annealing. After
        creating an initial implementation in Python and verifying its
        effectiveness, we rewrote the optimizer in C++ and incorporated numerous
        optimizations like the use of SIMD instructions and loop unrolling. This
        allowed us to complete billions of steps of simulated annealing each
        second. We combined this with the ILP formulation by initializing the
        linear program with the solutions found via simulated annealing, then
        optimizing them even further with Gurobi. <br />
        <br />
        We used this algorithm as part of our solution for the Fall 2022 CS 170
        project competition, and we received 2nd place out of a class of 600+
        for finding some of the most optimal solutions!

        In this data analysis report, we investigated trends in pricing and
        performance metrics for 3400+ consumer CPUs released in the last few
        decades. After retrieving, cleaning, and analyzing over 300k data points
        gathered from online benchmarking sites UserBenchmark and Passmark, we
        were able to gain insight into how CPUs have evolved over time. <br />
        <br />
        Some of our main insights included the breakdown of Moore's law, the
        shift to multi-core CPUs, and the fluctuations in market share between
        Intel and AMD. The most interesting discovery, however, was that online
        benchmarking site UserBenchmark was actually biased in favor of Intel
        CPUs! We found that PassMark was a much better predictor of actual CPU
        performance, meaning consumers could be easily misled by UserBenchmark's
        CPU rankings.
