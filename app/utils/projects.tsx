        Learn about programming in a whole new way with AutoBlog. <br /> <br />
        Todayâ€™s blogging sites just arenâ€™t made for sharing code. Tired of
        reading about the way your folder structure should look or trying to
        decide whether your terminal output matches the authorâ€™s? We have tools
        for those things - theyâ€™re called code editors. Why not learn to code in
        the same place you write it? <br /> <br />
        With AutoBlog, you can connect you own codebase in one click and scroll
        through tutorial articles like{" "}
        <a href="https://scrollycoding-preview-anish-shanbhag.vercel.app/posts/dotted-curve">
          this one about creating a cool-looking design
        </a>
        , all while watching your local code change in real-time as the author
        explains each step. Blog authors can even highlight snippets of code
        that tie into their explanations and insights, making it easier than
        ever to understand how the authorâ€™s written ideas connect with your own
        project. <br /> <br />

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">Mancala</a> is one of
        the world&apos;s oldest board games and has a storied history dating
        back over 1,300 years. Despite this, there has been relatively little
        research into AI systems that can effectively play the strategy-based
        game. <br /> <br />
        I&apos;ve been playing Mancala for as long as I can remember, and wanted
        to see if I could create a worthy AI-based opponent. I began to
        investigate effective ML methods for training an optimal player; this
        project is the result of that effort: a neural network-based approach
        which is trained via two unsupervised algorithms, deep Q learning and
        neuroevolution (a genetic algorithm), resulting in a pretty smart system
        that achieves a 98% winrate. I still haven&apos;t beat it to this day ðŸ˜…

        In this action-packed game where MOBA meets tower defense, you&apos;ll
        find yourself immersed in a world of 2D battles illuminated by vibrant
        and radiant characters. There&apos;s limitless ways to craft and expand
        your base as you work with your team to engage in strategic combat and
        outsmart your opponents. <br /> <br />
        Enemies in Nexus Clash have custom-built AI targeting and behavior
        systems, making sure players are always on their toes. Online play is
        also possible thanks to Unity&apos;s Photon networking engine, which I
        used to design a low-latency systems to ensure that gameplay is fluid.
        <br /> <br />
        All of the visual effects and art were designed and implemented from
        scratch by me! It was super fun bringing this world to life with
        particle simulations and glowing sprites.

        BlendCanvas is a new JavaScript-esque programming language which is used
        to write compute and fragment shaders that are optimized to run on the
        GPU. This enables web and game developers to easily create complex
        graphics even if they&apos;re unfamiliar with GLSL, which is the
        low-level, often hard-to-understand language that you&apos;d normally
        use to write these shaders. BlendCanvas is nearly identical to
        JavaScript with a few extra features to make writing GPU code easier,
        and seamlessly compiles to GLSL for full interoperability with the
        larger shader ecosystem. <br />
        <br />
        Along with writing a full parser and compiler for the language itself,
        I&apos;ve also created a showcase platform where people can share their
        shaders and edit them in the browser without the need to download any
        additional software. All shaders are stored persistently using Firebase
        storage and authentication, so your creations will be available forever!
