        Learn about programming in a whole new way with AutoBlog. <br /> <br />
        Todayâ€™s blogging sites just arenâ€™t made for sharing code. Tired of
        reading about the way your folder structure should look or trying to
        decide whether your terminal output matches the authorâ€™s? We have tools
        for those things - theyâ€™re called code editors. Why not learn to code in
        the same place you write it? <br /> <br />
        With AutoBlog, you can connect you own codebase in one click and scroll
        through tutorial articles like{" "}
        <a href="https://scrollycoding-preview-anish-shanbhag.vercel.app/posts/dotted-curve">
          this one about creating a cool-looking design
        </a>
        , all while watching your local code change in real-time as the author
        explains each step. Blog authors can even highlight snippets of code
        that tie into their explanations and insights, making it easier than
        ever to understand how the authorâ€™s written ideas connect with your own
        project. <br /> <br />

        project, presented at a UC Berkeley SCET startup competition!

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">Mancala</a> is one of
        the world&apos;s oldest board games and has a storied history dating
        back over 1,300 years. Despite this, there has been relatively little
        research into AI systems that can effectively play the strategy-based
        game. <br /> <br />
        I&apos;ve been playing Mancala for as long as I can remember, and wanted
        to see if I could create a worthy AI-based opponent. I began to
        investigate effective ML methods for training an optimal player; this
        project is the result of that effort: a neural network-based approach
        which is trained via two unsupervised algorithms, deep Q learning and
        neuroevolution (a genetic algorithm), resulting in a pretty smart system
        that achieves a 98% winrate. I still haven't beat it to this day ðŸ˜…
